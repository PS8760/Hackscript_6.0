Problem Statement Title :- 
Development of AI-ML based models for predicting prices of agri-horticultural commodities such as pulses 
and vegetable (onion, potato, onion).


Description:-  
The Department of Consumer Affairs monitors the daily prices of 22 essential food commodities through 
550 price reporting centres across the country. The Department also maintains buffer stock of pulses, viz., 
gram, tur, urad, moon and masur, and onion for strategic market interventions to stabilize the volatility 
in prices. Decisions for market interventions such as release of stocks from the buffer are taken on the 
basis of the price trends and outlook. At present, the analyses of prices are based on the seasonality, 
historical and emerging trends, market intelligence inputs, crop sowing and production estimates. ARIMA 
based economic models have also been used to examine and forecast prices of pulses.


Approach towards the solution :-

Seasonality: Prices often follow seasonal patterns (e.g., onion prices spike during monsoon due to supply shortages).
Historical Trends: Past price data is used to predict future trends.
Market Intelligence: Reports on demand-supply gaps, trade dynamics, and other market factors.
Crop Sowing and Production Estimates: Data on crop yields and sowing patterns.
ARIMA Models: Traditional time-series models for price forecasting.

However, these methods may not fully capture the complexity of price dynamics, especially with external factors like weather, global market trends, and supply chain disruptions.

Step 1: Define the Scope
Focus on key commodities: Start with pulses (gram, tur, urad, moon, masur) and onion, as they are critical for buffer stock interventions.

Objective: Build a model to predict prices 1-2 weeks in advance to enable timely market interventions.

Step 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Sources:

Historical Price Data: Daily prices from 550 reporting centers.
Buffer Stock Data: Information on buffer stock levels of pulses and onion.
Crop Data: Sowing and production estimates from government reports.
Weather Data: Rainfall, temperature, and humidity data from meteorological departments.
Market Intelligence: Reports on demand-supply gaps, trade policies, and global market trends.
External Factors: Fuel prices, transportation costs, and inflation rates.

Data Preprocessing:
Clean data (handle missing values, outliers).
Normalize/standardize data for model training.
Create time-series features (e.g., lagged prices, moving averages).
Integrate external factors (e.g., weather indices, global price trends).

Step 3: Feature Engineering
Temporal Features: Lagged prices, moving averages, seasonality indicators.
Weather Features: Rainfall, temperature, humidity indices.
Crop Features: Sowing area, production estimates, yield trends.
Market Features: Buffer stock levels, demand-supply gaps, global prices.
Economic Features: Inflation rates, fuel prices, transportation costs.

Step 4: Model Selection
Use a hybrid approach combining traditional and advanced models:

Baseline Models:
ARIMA/SARIMA: Traditional time-series models for benchmarking.
Prophet: Facebook’s time-series model for seasonality and trend analysis.
Machine Learning Models:
Random Forest: For handling non-linear relationships.
XGBoost/LightGBM: Gradient boosting models for high accuracy.
Deep Learning Models:
LSTM/GRU: Recurrent neural networks for capturing temporal dependencies.

Hybrid Model:
Combine ARIMA (for linear trends) with LSTM (for non-linear patterns).

Step 5: Model Training and Validation
Train-Test Split:
Use 70-80% of data for training and 20-30% for testing.
Ensure the split respects temporal order (no data leakage).

Cross-Validation:
Use time-series cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

Evaluation Metrics:
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures prediction accuracy.
MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Average error magnitude.
MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): Percentage error for interpretability.

Step 6: Model Deployment
Real-Time Predictions:
Deploy the best-performing model on a cloud platform (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
Use APIs to provide real-time price predictions.

Dashboard:
Build a user-friendly dashboard (using Tableau, Power BI, or Streamlit) to visualize price trends and predictions.

Include features like:
Historical price trends.
Predicted prices for the next 1-2 weeks.
Key drivers of price changes (e.g., weather, buffer stock levels).

Step 7: Monitoring and Maintenance
Continuously monitor model performance.

Retrain the model with new data to adapt to changing market dynamics.
Incorporate feedback from policymakers to improve the system.

Innovative Features to Stand Out
Explainable AI:
Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME to explain model predictions.
Help policymakers understand the key drivers of price changes.

Scenario Analysis:
Simulate the impact of different market interventions (e.g., releasing buffer stocks, import/export policies).

Early Warning System:
Build an alert system to notify policymakers when prices are predicted to cross critical thresholds.

Scalability:
Design the system to be easily adaptable to other commodities and regions.

Tech Stack
Programming Languages: Python, R.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Statsmodels, Prophet.
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau, Streamlit.
Cloud Platforms: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for deployment.



#ARIMA
Why ARIMA is a Good Choice
Interpretability:
ARIMA is a statistical model, and its parameters (p, d, q) have clear meanings. Judges will appreciate your ability to explain the model in simple terms.

Handles Seasonality and Trends:
ARIMA can model seasonality and trends in price data, which are critical for agri-horticultural commodities.

Low Computational Cost:
ARIMA is computationally lightweight compared to deep learning models like LSTM, making it easier to implement and present.

Proven Track Record:
ARIMA has been used in many real-world forecasting problems, including price prediction, so judges will recognize its credibility.

Step-by-Step ARIMA Implementation
Step 1: Understand the ARIMA Model
ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average and has three components:

AR (AutoRegressive):
Models the relationship between an observation and its lagged values.
Parameter: p (number of lag observations).

I (Integrated):
Differencing the data to make it stationary (remove trends and seasonality).

Parameter: d (degree of differencing).

MA (Moving Average):
Models the relationship between an observation and residual errors from a moving average model.

Parameter: q (size of the moving average window).
The ARIMA model is denoted as ARIMA(p, d, q).

Step 2: Preprocess the Data
Load the Data:
Use historical price data for the selected commodities (e.g., onion, potato, pulses).

Check for Stationarity:
Use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check if the data is stationary.
If the data is not stationary, apply differencing (d parameter).

Handle Missing Values:
Fill missing values using interpolation or forward/backward filling.

Visualize the Data:
Plot the time series to identify trends, seasonality, and outliers.

Step 3: Identify ARIMA Parameters
Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF):

Use ACF and PACF plots to identify the values of p and q.

ACF: Helps identify the q parameter (MA component).
PACF: Helps identify the p parameter (AR component).

Grid Search for Optimal Parameters:
Use a grid search to find the best combination of p, d, and q that minimizes error metrics (e.g., AIC, BIC).

Step 4: Train the ARIMA Model
Split the Data:
Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

Fit the Model:
Use the ARIMA function from the statsmodels library in Python to fit the model.

Validate the Model:
Use the testing set to validate the model’s performance.

Step 5: Evaluate the Model
Error Metrics:
Use metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) to evaluate the model.

Visualize Predictions:
Plot the predicted vs. actual prices to show how well the model performs.

Step 6: Make Predictions
Forecast Future Prices:
Use the trained ARIMA model to predict prices for the next 1-2 weeks.

Confidence Intervals:
Provide confidence intervals for the predictions to show the uncertainty in the forecasts.
