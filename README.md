Seasonality: Prices often follow seasonal patterns (e.g., onion prices spike during monsoon due to supply shortages).

Historical Trends: Past price data is used to predict future trends.

Market Intelligence: Reports on demand-supply gaps, trade dynamics, and other market factors.

Crop Sowing and Production Estimates: Data on crop yields and sowing patterns.

ARIMA Models: Traditional time-series models for price forecasting.

However, these methods may not fully capture the complexity of price dynamics, especially with external factors like weather, global market trends, and supply chain disruptions.
Step 1: Define the Scope
Focus on key commodities: Start with pulses (gram, tur, urad, moon, masur) and onion, as they are critical for buffer stock interventions.

Objective: Build a model to predict prices 1-2 weeks in advance to enable timely market interventions.

Step 2: Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Sources:

Historical Price Data: Daily prices from 550 reporting centers.

Buffer Stock Data: Information on buffer stock levels of pulses and onion.

Crop Data: Sowing and production estimates from government reports.

Weather Data: Rainfall, temperature, and humidity data from meteorological departments.

Market Intelligence: Reports on demand-supply gaps, trade policies, and global market trends.

External Factors: Fuel prices, transportation costs, and inflation rates.

Data Preprocessing:

Clean data (handle missing values, outliers).

Normalize/standardize data for model training.

Create time-series features (e.g., lagged prices, moving averages).

Integrate external factors (e.g., weather indices, global price trends).

Step 3: Feature Engineering
Temporal Features: Lagged prices, moving averages, seasonality indicators.

Weather Features: Rainfall, temperature, humidity indices.

Crop Features: Sowing area, production estimates, yield trends.

Market Features: Buffer stock levels, demand-supply gaps, global prices.

Economic Features: Inflation rates, fuel prices, transportation costs.

Step 4: Model Selection
Use a hybrid approach combining traditional and advanced models:

Baseline Models:

ARIMA/SARIMA: Traditional time-series models for benchmarking.

Prophet: Facebookâ€™s time-series model for seasonality and trend analysis.

Machine Learning Models:

Random Forest: For handling non-linear relationships.

XGBoost/LightGBM: Gradient boosting models for high accuracy.

Deep Learning Models:

LSTM/GRU: Recurrent neural networks for capturing temporal dependencies.

Hybrid Model:

Combine ARIMA (for linear trends) with LSTM (for non-linear patterns).

Step 5: Model Training and Validation
Train-Test Split:

Use 70-80% of data for training and 20-30% for testing.

Ensure the split respects temporal order (no data leakage).

Cross-Validation:

Use time-series cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

Evaluation Metrics:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Measures prediction accuracy.

MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Average error magnitude.

MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): Percentage error for interpretability.

Step 6: Model Deployment
Real-Time Predictions:

Deploy the best-performing model on a cloud platform (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).

Use APIs to provide real-time price predictions.

Dashboard:

Build a user-friendly dashboard (using Tableau, Power BI, or Streamlit) to visualize price trends and predictions.

Include features like:

Historical price trends.

Predicted prices for the next 1-2 weeks.

Key drivers of price changes (e.g., weather, buffer stock levels).

Step 7: Monitoring and Maintenance
Continuously monitor model performance.

Retrain the model with new data to adapt to changing market dynamics.

Incorporate feedback from policymakers to improve the system.

Innovative Features to Stand Out
Explainable AI:

Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME to explain model predictions.

Help policymakers understand the key drivers of price changes.

Scenario Analysis:

Simulate the impact of different market interventions (e.g., releasing buffer stocks, import/export policies).

Early Warning System:

Build an alert system to notify policymakers when prices are predicted to cross critical thresholds.

Scalability:

Design the system to be easily adaptable to other commodities and regions.
