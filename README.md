Seasonality: Prices often follow seasonal patterns (e.g., onion prices spike during monsoon due to supply shortages).

Historical Trends: Past price data is used to predict future trends.

Market Intelligence: Reports on demand-supply gaps, trade dynamics, and other market factors.

Crop Sowing and Production Estimates: Data on crop yields and sowing patterns.

ARIMA Models: Traditional time-series models for price forecasting.

However, these methods may not fully capture the complexity of price dynamics, especially with external factors like weather, global market trends, and supply chain disruptions.
